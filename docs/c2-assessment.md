By the time you arrive Mr C has had his CT head 

![Case 2 CT]({{site.url}}/img/c2ct.jpg)

You review his history:

* Overnight his cardiovascular observations have been normal. According to the nursing notes he "slept through the night", there were no neurological observations done.
* He was admitted 1 week ago with a NSTEMI and had coronary artery bypass surgery planned in 2 days time.
* He has known atrial fibrillation
* Warfarin was being with-held pre-operatively with aspirin cover
* Other history includes hypertension and osteoarthritis
* Prior to admission he was mobilising with a walker at a rest home and required some help with showering

**Examination findings:**
BP 140/90
HR 75/min in atrial fibrillation
Drowsy, not opening eyes
Right homonymous hemianopia
Eyes deviated to left
Aphasic
Complete right-sided hemiparesis
NIHSS = 24

**Blood tests:**
Haemoglobin 140g/L
INR 1.7
Platelets 240
Creatinine 86

### Does the time of onset in this case contraindicate thrombolysis?
{: .MCQ}
  
* Yes
* Correct. His stroke onset time is unknown and could have been anytime after he fell asleep. It is hoped that advanced imaging may in the future better determine stroke duration but this is not yet routinely available or validated.
* No
* Incorrect. Ischemic stroke does not typically wake patients. Consequently the time of onset in patients waking with stroke symptoms must be taken as the time they fell asleep or were last seen well. This patient 'slept through the night'. His stroke duration could already be as long as 12 hours.

### Does this patients CT head scan by itself contraindicate thrombolysis?
{: .MCQ}
  
* Yes
* Correct. The scan shows extensive early hypodensity involving the entire left MCA territory. Most protocols suggest that hypodensity of more than 1/3 of the MCA territory is a relative contraindication. 
* No
* Incorrect. The scan shows extensive early hypodensity involving the entire left MCA territory. Extensive and obvious changes such as these invariably indicate irreversible infarction, likely of at least 9 hours duration. There is very little chance of benefit and the risk of hemorrhagic transformation is significantly increased. 

### Does his INR (1.7) exclude him from thrombolysis?
{: .MCQ}
  
* No - if reversed with FFP first
* Incorrect. While the exact INR cutoff depends on other patient specific factors it is generally agreed that reversing the INR with procoagulant FFP is inappropriate.
* Yes
* Correct. It remains unclear what level of mild INR elevation can be considered safe for thrombolysis and in reality this likely depends on other patient specific factors. The suggested exclusion cutoff of > 1.3 in this course is conservative. There is some non-randomoized data suggesting that in otherwise optimal patients a level of up to 1.7 may be acceptable. This patient already has a number of other adverse factors.

### Does this patients level of pre-morbid functioning exclude him from thrombolysis?
{: .MCQ}

* Yes
* Incorrect. This is in part a judgement call but a non-fatal stroke in such a patient could easily result in a loss of function requiring private hospital level of care. There is convincing data that advanced age should not by itself contraindicate patients. The EU mandated age cutoff of 80 has never been advocated in New Zealand. 
* No
* Correct. This patient is contraindicated for other reasons, but his pre-morbid functioning is not one of them! Patients with severely impaired premorbid functional status with a limited life expectancy are considered not suitable for thrombolysis. This includes patients who are fully-dependant, severely demented or have an advanced terminal illness.

### Mr C had a coronary angiogram 5 days ago via a radial puncture. Is this an exclusion from thrombolysis?
{: .MCQ}
	
* Yes
* Incorrect. Recent non-compressible arterial puncture is a relative contraindication. A radial artery angiogram is a compresible site. The recent NSTEMI is a more significant concern.
* No
* Correct. This is a compressible site and by itself would not contraindicate this patient.
