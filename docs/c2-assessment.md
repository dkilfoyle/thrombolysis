* Other history includes hypertension and osteoarthritis
* Prior to admission he was mobilising with a walker at a rest home and required help with showering and toileting

### Is this patient a thrombolysis candidate?
{: .MCQ}
	
* No
* This patient is contraindicated from thrombolysis.
* Yes - there are no contraindications
* No - there are multiple contraindications, the most important being unknown time of onset. Remember, patients do not typically wake up at stroke onset. Patients waking with neurological deficit may have had stroke onset anytime after falling asleep and consequently time of onset should be assumed to be time last seen awake and well.
* Possibly - need more history about time of onset
* No. TODO: elaborate
* Possibly - need to reduce the INR with vitamin K first
* No. TODO: elaborate
* Possibly - need to ensure he was independent at the rest home
* No. TODO: elaborate

### Purely based on this patients time of onset would he be a candidate for thrombolysis?
{: .MCQ}
  
* Yes
* No

### Purely based on this patients CT head scan would he be a candidate for thrombolysis?
{: .MCQ}
  
* Yes
* No

### Does his INR (1.5) exclude him from thrombolysis?
{: .MCQ}
  
* No
* Only if it cannot be reduced with vitamin K
* Yes

### Does this patients level of pre-morbid functioning exclude him from thrombolysis?
{: .MCQ}

* Yes
* No

### Mr C had a coronary angiogram 5 days ago via a radial puncture. Is this an exclusion from thrombolysis?
{: .MCQ}
	
* Yes
* No
