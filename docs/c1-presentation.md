You are the senior general medical registrar on call covering acute stroke. Your consultant is at home. It is 2130 and ED calls you...

"Hi there, I have a 76-year-old previously independent women who has just arrived in resus. She seems to have had a stroke. It started suddenly 2 hours ago and she's got left sided weakness and slurred speech. She might be a candidate for thrombolysis. Her airway is safe. The nurse has just sent off some bloods and put in a line. Can you come and assess her please?"

### What else should you ask over the phone before seeing the patient?
{: .MCQ}
       
* Nothing
* Incorrect. Having ED request a CT Head before you get there will save time and free you up to assess the patient
* Ask the ED consultant to arrange an urgent CT Head scan and call you back with the result
* Incorrect. Getting the CT organized is a good idea but waiting for them to call you back with the result would undoubtedly delay the patients time to thrombolysis. Go see the the patient now.
* Go over the history and examination findings in more detail
* Incorrect. They have already given you enough information to determine the potential need for thrombolysis. It is now your responsibility to take the history directly and examine the patient before deciding about thrombolysis.
* Ask the ED consultant to arrange an urgent CT Head scan and go see the patient yourself with high priority
* Correct! ED have provided adequate information to determine this patient may be a thrombolysis candidate. It is essential to manage time efficiently to maximise the patients chance of successful treatment. One of the biggest potential delays is waiting for a CT Head scan. Alerting radiology at the earliest possible time will reduce delays and free you up to assess the patient. Calling you back with the result or going over the history over the phone with ED would delay the patients time to thrombolysis and is inappropriate.
