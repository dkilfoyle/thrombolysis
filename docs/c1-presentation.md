You are the senior general medical registrar on call covering acute stroke. Your consultant is at home. It is 2130 and ED calls you...

"Hi there, I have a 76-year-old previously independent women who has just arrived in resus. She seems to have had a stroke. It started suddenly 2 hours ago and she's got left sided weakness and slurred speech. She might be a candidate for thrombolysis. Her airway is safe. The nurse has just sent off some bloods and put in a line. Can you come and assess her please?"
