The purpose of this learning resource is to expose you to clinical situations commonly encountered when treating patients with acute stroke.

Hopefully you have already completed â€˜Introduction to stroke thrombolysis'. These scenarios will build on the knowledge already gained by exposing you three real cases.

You will be required to answer MCQs throughout the scenarios. It is therefore important you read the initial case presentations carefully. Read the feedback carefully.

We hope you enjoy this learning experience!
