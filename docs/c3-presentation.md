You are the on call consultant covering stroke acutes. Your registrar is extremely ill so you are kindly admitting patients.

ED calls:

"I need your help! Please come and see this 67 year old women, Mrs V. She came in with SVT that self-reverted. She was fine, but about half an hour ago she suddenly started slurring her speech and developed left sided weakness that is quite severe. Her eyes are doing funny things as well, they seem to be moving in different directions. Could you come and see her, she's getting a CT head now".

You get to resus as the patient is being wheeled back from her CT. The patient cannot speak, so you confirm the history with her partner and ED. It seems clear that her neurological symptoms started only 30 minutes ago.

Her ECG on arrival showed a regular supraventricular tachycardia at 180 beats per minute. She now back in sinus rhythm with normal QRS morphology and PR/QT intervals.

She has no significant past medical history other than infrequent palpitations and is on no medications. There is no history of illicit drug use.

**Examination:**

GCS 14
Eye movements: Paralysis of horizontal eye movements except for lateral movement of the left eye (one and a half syndrome). Restricted vertical gaze and horizontal nystagmus
Pupils: left 4mm, right 2mm (both reactive)
Bilateral partial ptosis
Reduced left corneal reflex
Moderate dysarthria
Tongue deviation to the left
Absent gag reflexes bilaterally
Severe left arm and leg weakness

CT Head - reported as normal by the on call registrar

### Your working diagnosis is acute ischemic stroke. Which cerebral artery territory is most likely affected?
{: .MCQ}
  
* Right middle cerebral artery
* Incorrect. A stroke in this territory can produce various combinations of contralateral hemiplegia, hemisensory loss, homonymous hemianopia and dysphasia (if dominant side affected). Conjugate eye deviation away from the hemiparetic side can be seen in large MCA territory infarction. Dysconjugate gaze as in this patient would not occur unless there has been major mass effect and uncal herniation. The CT did show not this complication.
* Bilateral middle cerebral arteries
* Incorrect.
* Basilar artery
* Correct. It is important to remember that hemiparesis is not synonymous with middle cerebral artery stroke. The pyramidal tracts also run through the brainstem. Depending on size and location basilar stroke can cause hemiparesis, quadraparesis or asymmetric quadraparesis. Basilar stroke is the best explanation for the eye movement disorder and other cranial nerve signs.
* Anterior cerebral artery
* Incorrect. Infarction of this territory usually presents with a contralateral lower limb paresis.
