1. Are you *confident* this is a stroke? If not then **Stop** 
2. Perform NIHSS (scored neurological examination, recommended) 
3. General clinical exam (exclude bleeding contraindications)

### Is it a stroke? 

* Acute **focal** neurological deficit
* Likely vascular in origin, no other explanation
* Red flags it's not a stroke: loss of consciousness, severe or explosive headache

### NIHSS 

* [Standardized neurological exam]({{site.url}}/resources/NIHSS.pdf) for stroke patients
* Useful in determining if a stroke is of suitable severity to warrant thrombolysis
* Recommended but not mandatory

### Which of the following patient scenarios *might* be suitable for stroke thrombolysis?
{: .MCQ}
 
* Acute confusion, no focal signs
* No. There is a broad differential for this presentation. 
* Right hemiparesis following a focal seizure in a known epileptic
* No. Post-sz hemiparesis is an acute focal deficit but is not vascular/ischemic in mechanism.
* Acute right hemiparesis of unknown cause
* Correct. In the absence of an alternative explanation an acute focal deficit of this sort is often ischemic.
* Spreading wave of unilateral paresthesia in a patient with prior history of migraine  
* No. Migrainous focal deficits can be difficult to distinguish from acute stroke. Headache may be delayed or not occur at all. Useful clues include a prior history of similar spontaneously resolving events, or a slowly spreading wave of positive sensory or visual symptoms (paresthesia, scintillations). Recommend discuss with on-call neurologist if uncertain.
