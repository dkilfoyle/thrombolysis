1. You are confident the diagnosis is stroke and the time of onset is reasonably established? 
2. The stroke is sufficiently severe to warrant the risks (see below) but is not beyond help? 
	* Use NIHSS and clinical judgement to decide 
3. History, exam and initial investigations reveal no contraindication to thrombolysis? 
4. The CT is acceptable (see exclusion criteria Appendix 2) 
5. The current BP is acceptable (SBP < 185, DBP < 110) 
6. An onset to needle time of < 4.5h is still achievable? 
7. “Yes” to all 6 items above? Proceed, else seek expert opinion or Stop

### Confirmation

* Where and when available discussion with the local on-call neurology or stroke service is recommended. 
* CT 
	* The primary concern is exclusion of hemorrhage. CT is highly sensitive for acute blood. 
	* Subtle early ischemic changes on the CT are not a contraindication.
	* Extensive acute hypodensity usually indicates stroke duration > 4.5h. Carefully check the time of onset and probably do not treat.
	* Established hypodensity consistent with an old infarct is not a contraindication.
	* These determinations should be obvious to a radiology registrar. If in doubt ask for a consultant radiologist review. 

51 female. Longstanding hypertension on 3 drugs. Woke up, had shower, collapsed walking to kitchen. Drowsy, R) hemiplegia. BP 200/95. What should be the next step?
{: .MCQ}
 
* CT Head
* Correct. CT head in this patient shows a typical hypertensive ICH. Clinical features alone cannot distinguish infarction from hemorrhage. Acute blood is readily and immediately visible on plain CT. 
* Give thrombolysis immediately
* No. A CT should always be obtained before thrombolysis. Any degree of intracerebral bleeding is a contraindication. Never be tempted to thrombolyse without a CT. The the scanner is unavailable, send the patient to another hospital.
* Give IV labetolol to lower BP  
* Not yet. A CT is needed first to determine if the stroke is ischemic or hemorrhagic. 


45y old smoker. BIB found by neighbour collapsed on kitchen floor. O/E drowsy, mute, right hemiplegia. CT as shown. Which is correct?
{: .MCQ}
 
* Thrombolysis is contraindicated
* Correct. Thrombolysis is contraindicated. The scan shows extensive hypodensity involving the entire left MCA territory. It is  likely that the stroke began more than 4.5h ago based on this appearance. 
* Give thrombolysis if corobatory history can establish symptomatic onset < 4.5h ago.  
* No. Thrombolysis is contraindicated. The scan shows a large subacute infarct involving the entire left MCA territory. Obvious hypodensity > 1/3 of the MCA territory is a contraindication to thrombolysis. Hypodensity of this severity almost always indicates a stroke duration of > 6h at least. It also indicates extensive irreverible infarction and an increased risk of hemorrhage. Treatment should not be given even if the apparent symptom duration is < 4.5h. The pictures illustrate the usual extent of the MCA distribution. Chronic hypodensity due to a remote infarction > 3 months previously is not a contraindication. A competent radiology registrar should have no problem identifying these changes.  Subtle changes reported by the radiologist but usually not visible to casual inspection such as loss of grey white differentiation or sulcal effacement do not contraindicate treatment. Discuss with on-call  neurologist if uncertain.
