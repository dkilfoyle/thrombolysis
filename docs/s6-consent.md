1. Obtain written (preferably) consent from family member and/or patient if suitable 
2. Benefit : “Improves probability of a complete recovery by 30-50%” 
	* eg 0-3h tx: chance of complete recovery (Mod Rankin 0-1) increases from 25% to 39% 
3. Risks 
	* Approximately 5% risk of ICH which could be fatal 
	* 1% risk of bleeding elsewhere 
	* Rare allergic reactions 
4. Overall significantly more likely to help than to harm

### Comment

Stroke thrombolysis is complex to discuss with patients and families. There are three possible outcomes: the patient may benefit and have a milder stroke than they would otherwise, there may be no change in outcome, or the patient could have a complication and be worse off. There are two important concepts that are important to disuss:
 
1. Overall the treatment is much more likely to benefit than to harm
2. Complications can occur unpredictably. ICH is a serious and potentially fatal complication.

You should check if your institution has a patient information sheet. The [pathway document](pathway.pdf) contains an example.
