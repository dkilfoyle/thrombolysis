You discuss the case with the on call stroke neurologist. They agree that the patient would be a potential candidate for clot retrieval.
They request that you get an urgent CT angiogram while they arrange for the radiology, anaesthetics and intensive care teams to see the patient urgently.

The CT angiogram is performed within 10 minutes. This shows a focal occlusion in the mid-basilar artery which would be amenable to clot retrieval

The patient is anaesthetised in the catheterisation suite and the procedure is successful radiologically. Post clot retrieval angiography confirms excellent basilar patency.

On the following morning you find the patient sitting up in bed eating a hospital breakfast. Her neurological deficit has almost completely resolved.

## Conclusion

This case is an example of a dramatic response to intra-arterial clot retrieval. It is important to remember however that this form of treatment remains unproven as of early 2014. Safe and effective treatment requires specialized multidisciplinary expertise that will likely only be available at tertiary level hospitals. If pending randomized controlled trials prove efficacy then establishing pathways for patient selection and transfer from other hospitals will be a significant challenge. 

You have now completed the three case scenarios.
