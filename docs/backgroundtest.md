### In appropriately selected patients stroke thrombolysis will: 
{: .MCQ}
       

* Improve the likelihood of a complete functional recovery
* Correct. In the pivotal NINDS trial the likelihood of making a complete recovery improved from 26% to 39%.  Other patients also  had an improved outcome but did not completely recover.
* Reduce all cause mortality
* No. Thrombolysis does not affect overall mortality, positive or negative.
* Improve functional outcome in all treated patients
* No. Approximately 70% of treated patients outcome will be unchanged by thrombolysis
* Increase mortality due to excess bleeding  
* No. There is a small increase in fatal hemorrhage but there is no net affect on overall mortality.

### Regarding the risk of thrombolysis induced hemorrhage
{: .MCQ}
   
 
* The risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage is approx 10%
* No. The rate of asymptomatic hemorrhage however can be at least this high.
* The risk of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage is 6% or less
* Correct. This is the figure from the NINDS pivotal trial. Routine clinical experience confirms this is a valid real-world figure.
* The risk of extracranial hemorrhage is 5%  
* No. < 1% and probably slighly less than seen in cardiac thrombolysis in which the dose of TPA is slightly higher.
* Intracranial hemorrhage does not occur in patients with ischemic stroke not treated with TPA
* No. Hemorragic transformation can occur in untreated patients also.
