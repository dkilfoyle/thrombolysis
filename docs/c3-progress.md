The patient receives IV thrombolysis
You review the CT Head again and cleverly spot an abnormality in the mid basilar artery suspicious of a clot.

![Case 3 CT]({{site.url}}/img/c3ct.png)

The patient has shown no clinical signs of improvement and the IV thrombolysis infusion has almost finished.

### Could this patient be a candidate for clot retrieval?
{: .MCQ}
	
* Yes
* Correct. Patients with basilar artery or distal ICA/proximal MCA occlusions may be candidates for clot retrieval. This is often a difficult decision and will need to be discussed with the on call stroke neurologist. Patients can have IV thrombolysis first. If there is no clinical improvement after 1 hour (i.e. after the infusion is finished) then they may be candidates for clot retrieval. Decisions to perform clot retrieval must go through the neurologist. It is best to inform them early in the process to save time. The neuroradiology, anaesthetic and intensive care teams will all need to be alerted.
* No
* Incorrect - although clot retrieval should still be considered unproven there is emerging data and experience that this form of treatment can be very effective in the scenario of basilar occlusion, a condition which is otherwise associated with a very high risk of mortality or severe disability. 

### Up to how long after stroke onset can clot retrieval be performed for a) proximal MCA occlusion and b) basilar artery occlusion?
{: .MCQ}

* a) 6 hours, b) 6 hours
* Incorrect.
* a) 6 hours, b) 12 hours
* Correct. There is still much work to be done to define pathways for intra-arterial clot retrieval. Experience thus far indicates that longer time frames than intranveous thrombolysis can be used. Brainstem infarction has a lower risk of hemorrhagic transformation and together with the severe morbidity of untreated basilar occlusion longer timeframes may be reasonable. 
* a) 4.5 hours, b) 6 hours
* Incorrect.
* a) 4.5 hours, b) 4.5 hours
* Incorrect.
