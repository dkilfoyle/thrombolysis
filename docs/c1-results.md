The patient was not previously known to have atrial fibrillation and is not taking any anticoagulants.
She has a history of mild hypertension on bendrofluazide and no other significant problems, including no bleeding, brain haemorrhages, known strokes or recent procedures.
The patient is wheeled back from CT. This shows subtle early ischemia in the subcortical insular region on the right

Her blood pressure is rechecked. This has increased to 200/110

### What is the limit of acceptable blood pressure for stroke thrombolysis?
{: .MCQ}

* < 240/120
* No.
* < 220/120
* No.
* < 200/120
* No.
* < 200/100
* No. 
* < 180/105
* Correct. The absolute limit varies slightly between guidelines, but in general you want the systolic BP less than 180 before giving thrombolysis. This reduces the risk of haemorrhage.

### How should you manage her hypertension?
{: .MCQ}

* An oral calcium channel blocker
* Incorrect. Oral therapy is not indicated because it is too slow to work. Additionally the patients swallow may not be safe.
* IV hydralazine
* Incorrect but a reasonable second choice.
* IV labetalol
* Correct. This is the agent of first choice provided there is no history of asthma, heart block or heart failure. Labetalol 10-20mg IV is the first line treatment. It works fast and can be given every 10 minutes.
* Antihypertensive treatment is contraindicated in the setting of acute ischemic stroke
* Incorrect. Thrombolysis is an exception to the usual conservative approach to hypertension in ischemic stroke. SBP > 180mmHg increases the risk of hemorrage after thrombolysis. For patients with SBP in the 180-220 range 1-2 doses of an intravenous antihypertensive can be used in attempt to bring the blood pressure below SBP 180.  
* IV amiodarone
* No.
