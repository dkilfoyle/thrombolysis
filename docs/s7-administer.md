### Alteplase

* Door to needle time should be within 60min of ED presentation and ideally should be within 30-45min. Treatment benefit reduces rapidly between 2-4h post symptom onset.
* During infusion
	* Very important to maintain BP < 180/105 to minimize risk of hemorrhagic transformation
	* Rare complication of orofacial angioedema - see complications, usually rapidly responsive to tx
