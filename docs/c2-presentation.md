You are the on call stroke team registrar.

At 9am you receive a call from a cardiology registrar.

"Hi, one of my inpatients, Mr C, has just had a stroke. He is an 89 rest-home resident who was admitted 1 week ago with a NSTEMI and was just found unresponsive only 30 minutes ago. Now he can't talk or move his right side. Can you come and see him quickly for thrombolysis? He's just had his CT and is on his way back to the ward"

You go to assess the patient on the cardiology ward.

### Based on the information so far, does he have any exclusion criteria for IV thrombolysis?
{: .MCQ}
  
* Yes
* Correct! Having a myocardial infarction within the past 30 days is listed as a contraindication to IV thrombolysis. This is the only absolute exclusion based on the information given so far although some of the other features are also cause for concern.
* No
* Incorrect. Go back and have another read of the [inclusion and exclusion criteria]({{site.url}}/resources/pathway.pdf). Does he fulfill any of the exclusion criteria?

By the time you arrive Mr C has had his CT head

You review his history:

* Overnight his cardiovascular observations have been normal. According to the nursing notes he "slept through the night", there were no neurological observations done.
* He was admitted 1 week ago with a NSTEMI and had coronary artery bypass surgery planned in 2 days time.
* He has known atrial fibrillation
* Warfarin was being with-held pre-operatively with aspirin cover
* Other history includes hypertension and osteoarthritis
* Prior to admission he was mobilising with a walker at a rest home and required help with showering and toileting

Examination findings:

BP 140/90
HR 75/min in atrial fibrillation

Neurological exam:
Drowsy, not opening eyes
Right homonymous hemianopia
Eyes deviated to left
Aphasic
Complete right-sided hemiparesis
NIHSS = 24

Blood tests

Haemoglobin 140g/L
INR 1.7
Platelets 240
Creatinine 86

### Is this patient a thrombolysis candidate?
{: .MCQ}
	
* No
* This patient is contraindicated from thrombolysis.
* Yes - there are no contraindications
* No - there are multiple contraindications, the most important being unknown time of onset. Remember, patients do not typically wake up at stroke onset. Patients waking with neurological deficit may have had stroke onset anytime after falling asleep and consequently time of onset should be assumed to be time last seen awake and well.
* Possibly - need more history about time of onset
* No. TODO: elaborate
* Possibly - need to reduce the INR with vitamin K first
* No. TODO: elaborate
* Possibly - need to ensure he was independent at the rest home
* No. TODO: elaborate

### Purely based on this patients time of onset would he be a candidate for thrombolysis?
{: .MCQ}
  
* Yes
* No

### Purely based on this patients CT head scan would he be a candidate for thrombolysis?
{: .MCQ}
  
* Yes
* No

### Does his INR (1.5) exclude him from thrombolysis?
{: .MCQ}
  
* No
* Only if it cannot be reduced with vitamin K
* Yes

### Does this patients level of pre-morbid functioning exclude him from thrombolysis?
{: .MCQ}

* Yes
* No

### Mr C had a coronary angiogram 5 days ago via a radial puncture. Is this an exclusion from thrombolysis?
{: .MCQ}
	
* Yes
* No

There are many potential exclusions, but not all are absolute, e.g. those marked (*) Click on link below.
It is important to determine quickly whether the patient is a candidate for thrombolysis so that excess time is not wasted.
Running through the check-list with the patient or family member and reviewing the clinical notes for contraindications shouldn't take more than 5-10 minutes.
To make this easier print off the exclusion criteria and physically tick them off before getting consent.
