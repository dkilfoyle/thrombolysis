You are the on call stroke team registrar.

At 9am you receive a call from a cardiology registrar.

"Hi, one of my inpatients, Mr C, has just had a stroke. He is an 89 rest-home resident who was admitted 1 week ago with a NSTEMI and was just found unresponsive only 30 minutes ago. Now he can't talk or move his right side. Can you come and see him quickly for thrombolysis? He's just had his CT and is on his way back to the ward"

You go to assess the patient on the cardiology ward.

### Based on the information so far, does he have any exclusion criteria for IV thrombolysis?
{: .MCQ}
  
* Yes
* Correct! Having a myocardial infarction within the past 30 days is listed as a contraindication to IV thrombolysis. This is the only absolute exclusion based on the information given so far although some of the other features are also cause for concern.
* No
* Incorrect. Go back and have another read of the [inclusion and exclusion criteria]({{site.url}}/resources/pathway.pdf). Does he fulfill any of the exclusion criteria?
