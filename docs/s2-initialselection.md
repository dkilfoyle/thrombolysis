1. Timing â€“ the maximum allowable symptom onset to needle time is 4.5h 
	1. Woke with symptoms? If Yes then Stop unless asleep <3-4h 
	2. More than 4h ago or unknown? If Yes then Stop

## Patient Selection

### Timing

* It is crucial patients are not given TPA if time of onset was > 4.5h ago.
* Patients waking with symptoms may have had stroke onset anytime after falling asleep. Time of onset should therefore be conservatively taken as time fell asleep.
* In patients too drowsy or dysphasic to provide a history the time of onset should be taken as time last seen well by witness. If no recent witness then patient is not eligible for treatment.

### Severity

* Because thrombolysis is associated with a risk of ICH, minor strokes unlikely to result in significant disability should not be treated. A NIHSS score of < 4 is a guide. Occasionally an isolated deficit with NIHSS < 4 may be suitable for treatment eg an isolated but severe dysphasia.
* Patients who are obtunded with NIHSS > 22 usually have major infarction that is not likely to benefit and have a higher risk of hemorrhage. 
* A Rapidly resolving deficit should be observed for 30minutes. Persisting significant deficit may still warrant treatment even if there has been some improvement. Discuss with neurologist. 

### An 84 year old man was up at 0200h to watch the world cup soccer. Found by family 1000h on floor, GCS9, aphasic, complete right hemiplegia, eye deviation to left. Which is correct answer:

* He is too old to consider thrombolysis
* No. There is no specific age cutoff. The pathways presented here are for **adults**. For pediatric patients with acute ischemic stroke consult a pediatric neurologist.
* He should receive thrombolysis if his CT is normal
* No. Thrombolysis is contraindicated in this patient for 2 reasons: 1) Uncertain time of onset which could be up to 8h even with a normal CT. 2) The deficit is too severe, NIHSS > 22 (this cutoff is subject to debate).
* TPA is contraindicated
* Yes. Uncertain time of onset (remember, unlike a myocardiac infarct, patients will sleep through the onset of their stroke). The deficit is also too severe (although the upper limit NIHSS is a subject of debate).

### 50y old woman, smoker. 3h of acute left mild hemiparesis and dysarthria. Weakness improving in ED. CT shows subtle loss of insular ribbon consistent with acute ischemia.

* Thrombolysis should be given now
* No. the current deficit is mild and spontaneously improving. It is reasonable to defer thrombolysis decision and reassess.
* Thrombolysis is not necessary
* Maybe. The current deficit is mild and spontaneously improving. It is reasonable to defer thrombolysis decision for now and clinically reassess in 30 minutes. Improvement should be maintained and ongoing before thrombolysis is abandonded as some patients may initially improve slightly and then stop improving or deteriorate again.
* Thrombolysis is contraindicated due to abnormal CT
* No. Subtle CT findings such as loss of grey-white differentiation can be seen after 3h. These do not contraindicate TPA. Extensive acute hypodensity usually indicates a stroke > 5-6h in duration. Recheck time of onset and if in doubt discuss with radiology or on call neurologist.
* Reassess in 30 minutes  
* Correct. The current deficit is mild and spontaneously improving. Reasonable to defer TPA decision. Some patients will deteriorate after initial improvement and should be treated if still within the 4.5h window. Discuss with on call neurologist if uncertain.
