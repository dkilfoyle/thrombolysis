The risk of complications can be minimized by following the guidelines. The most important aspects to remember are are:

1. Time is brain. These patients need rapid workup. Aim for a door to needle of 45min.
2. Make sure the onset time is well defined. Do **not** thrombolyze after 4.5h.
3. Monitor BP closely and intervene early if > 180.
4. Ring someone to discuss if you are uncertain.
