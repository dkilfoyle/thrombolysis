She is now 45 minutes from the onset of symptoms
Clinically you suspect a basilar artery ischemic stroke
Her NIHSS is 14
The patient and her family consent to IV thrombolysis
There are no contraindications

### What should you do next?
{: .MCQ}
  
* Administer IV thrombolysis
* Correct! This patient is a candidate for thrombolysis (reliable time of onset, suitable neurological deficit, acceptable CT, no other contraindications). Treatment initiation should not be delayed.
* Get a CT angiogram
* No, not yet. A CTA might demonstrate a basilar occlusion confirming your clinical suspicion. However, this would not change your immediate management which is to proceed with intravenous thrombolysis. The short delay to send the patient back to radiology for a CTA at this point would be an unacceptable delay. Time is of critical importance in thrombolysis efficacy. 
* Get a neuroradiologist to review the CT head
* No, unless this can be obtained immediately without delay. The primary role of CT in thrombolysis workup is to exclude hemorrhage. Subtle early ischemic changes may be missed by a radiology registrar but such changes would not change treatment decision. Acute intracranial hemorrhage is usually easily and immediately visible on CT.
* Wait for 30 minutes to ensure this is not a TIA
* No. Even a delay as short as 30 minutes would adversely impact thrombolysis efficacy. A wait and see approach is only appropriate in situations in which the neurological deficit is already rapidly and dramatically improving.  
* Go straight to clot retrieval
* In 2014: No. Intra-arterial clot retrieval shows much promise but it's role has not yet been proven. Intravenous thrombolysis has proven efficacy. In 2014 the current recommendation is to given the proven treatment (intravenous thrombolysis) first.
