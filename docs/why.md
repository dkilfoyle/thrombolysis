Stroke thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator (TPA) within three hours of symptom onset improves the proportion of patients with complete recovery from 26% to 39%. 

The NNT to prevent 1 disabled patient = 7. 

The earlier the treatment after symptom onset, the greater the benefit.

Subsequent trials have shown that treatment is efficacious up to 4.5h after symptom onset.
