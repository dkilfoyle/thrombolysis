1. Intracranial 
	1. Usually presents as worsening  or new deficit, or fall in LOC in first 12h post TPA 
	2. Stop infusion if still running 
	3. Urgent PR (prothrombin ratio), APTT and fibrinogen 
	4. Urgent repeat CT 
	5. Discuss with on-call haematologist re possible FFP/Cryoppt 
	6. Discuss with on-call neurosurgical team (but surgery is usually not appropriate) 
	7. Intensive care, steroids, and osmotherapy are usually not appropriate 
	8. Note: Minor asymptomatic haemorrhage is common and does not worsen outcome. Large symptomatic haemorrhage has a poor prognosis and may be fatal. 
2. Extracranial 
	1. Compression, transfusion if indicated. Surgical treatment if indicated 
	2.Discuss with on-call haematologist as above

### Concepts

* Massive intracranial hemorrhage usually untreatable and fatal
* For moderate bleeds consider cryro 8u as a source of fibrinogen. 
* NeuroSurgery unlikely to be appropriate but if superficial or predominantly intraventricular discuss 

### 79y woman. AF on aspirin. Acute right hemiplegia, dysphasia, hemianopia. NIHSS 21. Initial CT normal. TPA at 4h. 6h later on ward GCS drops to 5. CT as shown.

* She should not have received TPA 
* No. This patient has some features that might increase bleeding risk (high NIHSS, long onset to needle) but data from the IST3 trial indicates that likelihood of benefit still outweighs harm in such a patient. Unfortunately hemorrhagic transformation cannot be reliably predicted and will rarely occur even in optimally selected and managed patients.
* Avoidance of severe hypertension reduces the risk of this complication
* Correct. Avoidance of severe hypertension reduces the risk of post thrombolysis hemorrhage. BP > 180/105 in the first 24h post infusion should be promptly treated. 
* With prompt neurosurgical intervention the prognosis is good
* No. The prognosis depends on the size and location of the bleeding. Small bleeds often do not alter long term prognosis. Large bleeds such as this unfortunately have a very poor prognosis.
