### Notes

* Check your local pathway document for recommended nursing observations
* Important features to monitor for are
	* Decreasing LOC or new/worsening focal deficits that might herald an ICH
	* Maintain BP < 180/100
	* Delayed systemic bleeding eg IV sites, scalp wounds (eg if stroke resulted in a fall)
