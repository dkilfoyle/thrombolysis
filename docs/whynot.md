The most serious potential complication is intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). 

TPA increases the risk of symptomatic ICH from 0.6% to 6%. 

TPA associated hemorrhage is :

* Usually untreatable and may be fatal
* Difficult to predict and can occur even in optimally selected patients

The risk can be reduced by careful patinet selection and close protocol adherence.
