The ED consultant agrees to request the CT Head and you arrive to quickly assess the patient.

Ambulance officers and family state she was well up until 730pm when she suddenly stopped talking and slumped over on the couch. They found her unable to move her left side or speak. She has no old notes on the system. FBC and glucose is normal.

Examination:
- HR is 80/min and irregularly irregular.
- BP 170/90.
- O2 sats normal. Afebrile.
- She is alert with severe dysarthria, but can follow commands.
- Partial left homonymous hemianopia.
- Her left face, arm and leg are all moderate-severely weak (can only just hold her limbs against gravity).
- Sensation seems to be normal, but is difficult to assess given her dysarthria.
- You calculate her NIHSS as 13
- At this point she is taken to radiology for her urgent non-contrast CT Head.

### What should you do now?
{: .MCQ}
  
* Review the CT with radiology before proceeding	
* Incorrect. There is more information required to determine if the patient is a candidate for TPA. Waiting till after the CT is unnecessary as this is still going to take at least 5-10 minutes to be completed.
* Go through the list of contraindications
* Correct! This is the next step to determine if she is a candidate for thrombolysis. It is important to determine if she is on any anticoagulants given she is in atrial fibrillation. Given the patient is severely dysarthric her family may need to help with the history. Briefly reviewing old clinical notes should also be done and may be the only source of information if there is no one available to provide a history. Your institution should have a policy document listing all contraindications. See [appendix 2]({{site.url}}/resources/pathway.pdf) of the generic pathway document for an example. 
* Discuss with your consultant
* Incorrect. Currently there is insufficient information to confirm whether the patient is a candidate for TPA. It is more efficient to obtain all the relevant information then call.
* Request a CT angiogram in addition to the non-contrast CT Head	
* Incorrect. A CT angiogram is unnecessary to determine whether a patient should receive IV TPA. Not infrequently a CT angiogram is requested after TPA to determine if a patient requires clot retrieval, but this could be done after IV TPA is administered to avoid delays
* Administer IV TPA 
* Incorrect. There is insufficient information to determine if this patient is a candidate yet. A CT Head is required to exclude haemorrhage and you need to ensure there are no exclusion criteria present
