The following sections will document the various steps in the assessment and management of a patient potentially suitable for thrombolysis. These steps are generic - please check your institution's local policy documentation.

These steps are based on the thrombolysis protocol used at Waitemata District Health Board with minor modifications to remove WDHB specific features (eg thrombolysis location). Feel free to print out the [pathway document]({{site.url}}/resources/pathway.pdf) and refer to it while completing this course and the MCQs.

## Whose Responsibility?

Individual hospitals will have differing resources with respect to responsibility for patient selection and treatment. Workup and treatment initiation may in different hospitals be administered by Emergency Physicians, on call Neurology serivces, a specialist stroke team or the on call Medical team. Responsibilty for treatment may differ even within the same institutition whether the patient is presenting during or after normal working hours 

<div class="note warning">
It is vitally important that you are familiar with the local policies and protocols of your hospital before treating any stroke patient with thrombolysis. It is strongly recommended that every institution that intends to provide stroke thrombolysis has a formal policy and agreed protocol with input from all relevant stake holders (eg Emergency Department, Medical Services, Radiology, Nursing).
