You chart 10mg of IV labetalol and the BP improves to 170/90. In the mean time you contact the on call consultant, who agrees that thrombolysis is appropriate.

After explaining the risks and benefits to the patient and her husband they both indicate they are happy to proceed. He signs the written consent form.


### How should her thrombolysis treatment be charted? Her weight is 50kg.

* IV TPA 4.5mg as a bolus and 40.5mg as an infusion over 60 minutes
* No. Use of the generic term 'TPA' is ambiguous charting and has led to prescription error in the past. Alteplase is the only thrombolytic currently approved for acute ischemic stroke. Tenecteplase is the thrombolytic most commonly used for acute **coronary** syndromes - it is not currently approved for use in acute ischemic stroke and uses a different dose regimen.
* IV TPA 5mg as a bolus and 45mg as an infusion over 60 minutes
* No. Total dose of alteplase should be 0.9mg/kg up to maximum of 90mg.
* IV Alteplase 4.5mg as a bolus and 40.5mg as an infusion over 60 minutes
* Correct! The dose of IV Alteplase is is 0.9mg/kg (up to max 90mg) - 10% bolus, and the rest over 60min. Remember we are talking about ALTEPLASE (ACTIYLSE = Trade name), not TENECTEPLASE.
