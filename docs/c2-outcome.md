Unfortunately Mr C is not a suitable candidate for stroke thrombolysis. In the future he may be a candidate for intra-arterial clot retrieval but the efficacy of this treatment is still being evaluated.

Not all of the exclusions listed in the [pathway document]({{site.url}}/resources/pathway.pdf) are absolute exclusions. Criteria marked with a '*' are those in which some consideration can be given. When in doubt always discuss such cases with a stroke specialists or neurologist.  If such a person is not available it may be most appropriate to take the conservative approach.
