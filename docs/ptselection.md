Patient selection is the single most critical step in the TPA pathway. The aim is to select those patients potentially most able to benefit and least likely to be harmed.

There are multiple inclusion/exclusion criteria that will be explained in the next section but the key features of patient selection are: 

* Confident clinical diagnosis of stroke 
* Well defined time of symptom onset < 4.5h before TPA commences
* Absence of blood on CT scan or other hemorrhagic risks
* Adequate blood pressure control
