Patient selection is the single most critical step in the TPA pathway. 
* Aim to select those patients potentially most able to benefit and least likely to be harmed.

There are multiple inclusion/exclusion criteria that will be explained in the next section but the key features of patient selection are: 

* Confident clinical diagnosis of stroke with a functionally significant deficit
* Well defined time of symptom onset < 4.5h before TPA commences
* Absence of blood on CT scan or other hemorrhagic risks
* Adequate blood pressure control
