1. BP > 180/105 â€“ increases the risk of ICH 
2. Use repeated doses of IV labetolol 10mg or GTN infusion 
	1. Labetolol 10mg slow IV push with cardiac monitoring (unless asthma, heart block, CHF) 
	2. Repeat Labetolol prn q10min up to maximum 200mg 
	3. GTN is per CCU protocol  
3. Avoid sudden large reductions in BP 

</div>

### Concepts

* Avoid severe hypertension which increases risk of hemorrhagic transformation
* Avoid large drops in BP which worsen cerebral ischemia due to impaired autoregulation
* Labetolol is best choice as repeated small IV boluses can provide tight BP control
* Consider hydralazine or GTN if B-blocker contraindicated
