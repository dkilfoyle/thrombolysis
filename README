Thanks to jekyllrb for the website template.

Add an issue if you want me to change something.

The format to insert an MCQ is:

### Ask the question here
{: .MCQ}

* Option 1
* Answer 1
* Option 2
* Answer 2
* Option ...
* Answer ...

Note the '{: .MCQ}'. This adds a class="MCQ" to the h3.
This is picked up by the javascript MCQ builder which will convert the ul into an MCQ.
